Win32-Socketpair
================

This module allows to create a bidirectional pipe on Windows that can
be used inside a select loop. It uses a TCP socket going through the
localhost interface to create the connection.

Also export winopen2() (and winopen2_5()) which use the socketpair to
perform a bidirection "piped open" allowing writing to the subprocess stdin
and copturing it stdout (and stderr).

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
